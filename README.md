# MyReads Project

This is the first deliverable project for Udacity's React course. This project converts a static website to a React app that uses a backend API to display and update data with a Search Filter built in. 

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Backend Server

The provided backend server is at https://reactnd-books-api.udacity.com 

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
